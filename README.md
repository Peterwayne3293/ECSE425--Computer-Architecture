# [ECSE425 - Computer Architecture](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/ecse-425)

Project repository for ECSE425 - Proposing hardware optimization changes for cache, made for adademic use.

## Description

Subject: Computer Architecture 

Topic: Effect on cache performance

Research question: What are the performance effects of changing the architecture of cache memory?

Research proposal: Our Team Bankers consists of Ismail Faruk, Nabila Aziz Shifat and Jiawei Ni. We plan to investigate the effects on the performance of cache memory using EduMIPS64 and Dinero cache simulator. We plan to explore on the performance of direct mapped caching and set associative caching, in comparison with the default setup and their effects on performance of the delay required to access particular levels of cache, the size of caches, etc.
